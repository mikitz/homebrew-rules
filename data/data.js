As such, reference the below table to determine the PCs' speeds when they travel on riding horses. Should a PC want to gallop on a horse for travel, a horse's galloping speed is 15 mph, which can be sustained for 1 hour. Attempting to gallop on a single horse for 2 hours or more requires the horse to push itself beyond its limits. As such, at the end of each hour, starting at the end of the 2nd hour, the horse that is being ridden must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw at the end of the hour. On a fail, the horse dies. On a success, the horse can go on for one more hour.<\/p>Pushing your horses beyond the period length pushes them beyond their physical limits requiring each horse that has been ridden within the current 8-hour period to make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a fail, the horse dies. On a success, the horse can travel for another hour. E.G. if I have 2 horses and have travelled for 8 hours, but want to keep travelling on the same horses, then every hour I must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw for each horse. On a fail, the horse dies. On a succes, I can push another hour if I so choose.<\/p>You'll notice that in the below table, if one has enough horses, one can travel for 24 hours continuously.
